what is Linux 
Few networking concepts 
what is ipadress 
 what is ipv4/ipv6 classifications
IP classifications in network
How to identify the network or subnet using ipadress 
what is subnet 
what is gateway   gateway is also called as router  



Linux :
 Linux is a operating system. 
  Linux can be used as multi user operating systems 
  Linux is a multi tasking operating system 
  Linux can be used for hosting our applications 
  Linux can be used as Load balancer using vrrip protocol 
  Linux can act as network router 
  
  
   os works 
   
   
  Linux will have namespaces . what is a namespaces
 
Namespaces are partions in kernel which takes care of specific resources 

Following are the namespaces in Linux 

Net namespace/network namespace
pid namespace/ process map namespace
mount namespace/ disk namespace
user namespace 




 Network??
 
 what is network??
 
 set of devices connected to each other for establishing communication is called network. 
 in each network each device is identified uniquly with the help of ipadress . 
 
 what is an ipadress ?? 
  its a logical names assigned for our devices to identify them uniquly in a network. 
  
  ip adress can be of 32 bit or 64 bit        
  
  32 bit ip adress are called as ipv4 
  64 bit ip adress are called as ipv6            2^n  n=8   255 

                              ip adress  192.168.0.1    the number before each period is called as one octate      1 octate = 8 bits      4*8=32 
							                             in ipv4 first 2 octates will indicate network   second 2 octates will indicate hostname in a network
                               ipv6 adress  fe80::a00:27ff:fe3f:2100  are in hexa decimal format  they are segregated with : 64 bit 
  
  
  
  classification in ipadress adresses. 
          CLASS A | CLASS B | CLASS C| CLASS D | CLASS E | CLASS F 
		  
		   CLASS A     192.0.0.1    16 thousand
		   CLASS B     192.168.0.1  6400 thousand 
		   CLASS C     192.10.12.0   256    
            
 
  
 subnet: 
      division of a a single network to small multiple networks is called subnet/sub networking
